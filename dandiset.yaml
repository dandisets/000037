description: "This dataset was collected for the Credit Assignment project, as part
  of the Allen Institute for Brain Science's OpenScope project, and is published in
  Gillon et al., 2021, bioRxiv.\n\nEach session file includes: (1) ROI dF/F traces,
  (2) ROI masks, (3) running velocity traces, (4) pupil diameter traces, (5) stimulus
  parameters, and (6) stimulus frame images.\n\nBriefly, mice were habituated to head-fixation
  on a running disc over a period of 11 days. Over the last 6 days, mice were presented
  with repeating stimulus sequences, with expected features. These sessions are not
  included in the dataset, as imaging was not performed.\n\nFollowing habituation,
  sequences with unexpected features were introduced over three sessions, while two-photon
  calcium imaging was performed in pyramidal neurons of primary visual cortex (VisP).
  Specifically, recordings for each mouse were made in one of four planes: L2/3 somata,
  L5 somata, L2/3 distal apical dendrites or L5 distal apical dendrites. \n\nAs mice
  gained experience with the unexpected sequences, responses to these events were
  found to evolve in opposite ways in the dendritic and somatic compartments.\n\nDataset
  includes 13 subjects, and at least 3 sessions per subject. Dataset includes sessions
  that were excluded from analysis for quality control reasons. See metadata Github
  repository for information on each session."
