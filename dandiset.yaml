description: "This dataset was collected for the Credit Assignment project, as part
  of the Allen Institute for Brain Science's OpenScope project. The most up-to-date
  links to the publications associated with this dataset (a dataset descriptor paper
  and an analysis paper) can be found by going to the metadata Github repository,
  linked below.\n\nBriefly, mice were habituated to head-fixation on a running disc
  over a period of 11 days. Over the last 6 days, mice were presented with repeating
  stimulus sequences, with consistent features. These sessions are not included in
  the dataset, as imaging was not performed.\n\nFollowing habituation, sequences with
  inconsistent features were introduced over three sessions, while two-photon calcium
  imaging was performed in pyramidal neurons of primary visual cortex (VisP). Specifically,
  recordings for each mouse were made in one of four planes: L2/3 somata, L5 somata,
  L2/3 distal apical dendrites or L5 distal apical dendrites. \n\nAs mice gained experience
  with the inconsistent sequences, responses to these events were found to evolve
  in opposite ways in the dendritic and somatic compartments.\n\nThe dataset includes
  13 subjects, and at least 3 sessions per subject. \n\nEach session file includes:
  (1) ROI dF/F traces, (2) ROI masks, (3) ROI tracking information (if applicable),
  (4) running velocity traces, (5) pupil diameter traces, (6) pupil centroid position
  traces in x, y, (7) stimulus parameters. Note that gaze was not computed for this
  dataset. What is provided is the position of the pupil centroid in the pupil recording
  videos.\n\nA second, larger, version of each file was also created and includes:
  (8) stimulus frame images (identifiable by `+image` in the file name).\n\nCertain
  sessions in this dataset were excluded from our analyses for quality control reasons.
  They are provided here, as the reasons we excluded them from our analyses may not
  pose a problem for all use cases. \n\nThe metadata Github repository, linked below,
  provides detailed information about each session, as well as links to a dataset
  descriptor paper and an analysis paper. "
