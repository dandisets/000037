description: 'This dataset was collected for the Credit Assignment project, as part
  of the Allen Institute for Brain Science''s OpenScope project. The most up-to-date
  links to the publications associated with this dataset (a dataset descriptor paper
  and an analysis paper) can be found by going to the metadata Github repository,
  linked below.


  Briefly, mice were habituated to head-fixation on a running disc over a period of
  11 days. Over the last 6 days, mice were presented with repeating stimulus sequences,
  with consistent features. These sessions are not included in the dataset, as imaging
  was not performed. Following habituation, sequences with inconsistent features were
  introduced over three sessions, while two-photon calcium imaging was performed in
  pyramidal neurons of primary visual cortex (VisP). Specifically, recordings for
  each mouse were made in one of four planes: L2/3 somata, L5 somata, L2/3 distal
  apical dendrites or L5 distal apical dendrites. As mice gained experience with the
  inconsistent sequences, responses to these events were found to evolve in opposite
  ways in the dendritic and somatic compartments.


  The dataset includes 50 sessions total, recorded in 13 subjects, with at least 3
  sessions per subject. Each session file includes: **(1)** ROI dF/F traces, **(2)**
  ROI masks, **(3)** ROI tracking information (where applicable), **(4)** running
  velocity traces, **(5)** pupil diameter traces, **(6)** pupil centroid position
  traces in x and y, **(7)** stimulus parameters. Note that gaze was not computed
  for this dataset. What is provided is the position of the pupil centroid in the
  pupil recording videos. In addition, a second, slightly larger version of each file
  was created, also including: **(8)** stimulus frame images (identifiable by `+image`
  in the file name). Lastly, a third, much larger version of each file was created,
  also including: **(9)** the motion corrected imaging stack (identifiable by `_obj-raw`
  in the file name).


  Certain sessions in this dataset were excluded from our analyses for quality control
  reasons. They are provided here, as the reasons we excluded them from our analyses
  may not pose a problem for all use cases. The metadata Github repository, linked
  below, provides detailed information about each session. '
